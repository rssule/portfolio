        <div class="body-text">Fighting Food Insecurity in Nigeria, One Optimized Basket at a Time.</div>
        <div class="body-text"><p style="text-align: justify;">This project offers a unique and innovative approach to address the critical issue of food insecurity in Nigeria. By leveraging machine learning models, we propose an optimal food basket designed to be affordable and culturally acceptable for Nigerian households. Our findings reveal two food basket models that can significantly reduce the cost of nutritious food and improve access to a variety of healthy options. As you continue to read, you will discover how our project can contribute to hunger alleviation, cash transfer, and health education programs in Nigeria. Join us in the fight against food insecurity and explore the exciting possibilities of optimized food baskets. I led a team of five Heinz College students in planning and executing this project.</p></div>

          <div class="body-text">
		  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nigeria is facing a severe food insecurity situation, with millions of people across the country struggling to access sufficient and nutritious food. The causes of food insecurity in Nigeria are complex and multi-faceted. Although the Nigerian government and international aid agencies have taken steps to address food insecurity, the scale of the problem remains significant and more needs to be done to alleviate food insecurity in Nigeria. To address the food insecurity issue for Nigerian households, we propose an additional tool for the government’s toolbox: an optimal food basket designed to be affordable and satisfy food consumption patterns of Nigerian households. Our project proposes the use of a random forest supervised learning model to predict the food insecurity levels of households (low, medium or high) based on a food insecurity indicator (Coping Strategies Index). Alternatively, if households' food insecurity status is known, we propose the use of a K-Means clustering unsupervised learning model to group Nigerian households into clusters based on their characteristics (including food coping behaviors). Our specific model suggests two clusters. The machine learning models are used to obtain median food expenditure for each household group, which is then used to design two food basket models: a low-cost and a low-cost & culturally-acceptable food basket. We found that the low-cost food basket model cost NGN 115 across household groups and comprised 4 food items. While the low-cost & culturally-acceptable food basket model comprised a wider variety of food items and was priced at the median food expenditure for each household group. As a means to fight food insecurity, we recommend the food basket model optimized for low-cost and culturally acceptability to the Nigerian government for implementation in hunger alleviation, cash transfer and health education programs. We acknowledge that our project is subject to several data, analytical and economic limitations, some of which we address as future work.</p>

	<div class="subheader-text">Problem Statement</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">
		  <p style="text-align: justify;">For Nigeria, food insecurity is a severe problem with the country ranking 103 of 121 countries assessed for the Global Hunger Index (GHI) in 2022<sup><a href="https://www.globalhungerindex.org/nigeria.html">[1]</a></sup>. With a population of over 200 million people, the WFP’s hunger map reports 57.7 million people in Nigeria with insufficient food consumption – that’s over a quarter of the population living with food uncertainty<sup><a href="https://hungermap.wfp.org/">[2]</a></sup>. Many Nigerian households struggle to afford a nutritionally adequate diet, leading to poor health outcomes and decreased quality of life. As it is crucial for everyone to have the equal access to sufficient and nutritious food to meet dietary needs, our research question is: How to design a nutritionally adequate, low-cost and culturally acceptable food basket (list of locally available food items) for Nigerian households based on the similarity of their food insecurity level as measured by the coping strategies index? This research is important for addressing food insecurity and improving the health and well-being of Nigerian households.</p>
		  <p>To answer our research question, we set the following objectives:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Calculate Nigerian households’ food insecurity levels based on the Coping Strategies Index (CSI)</li>
			  <li>Create sub-groups of Nigerian households with similar coping patterns</li>
			  <li>Predict Nigerian household food insecurity levels</li>
			  <li>Design optimal food baskets for Nigerian households in fulfillment of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nutrient recommendations while considering affordability and cultural acceptability</li>
			</ul>

		  <h3>Data Summary</h3>
		  <p style="text-align: justify;">The primary data source used for this project is the Nigeria General Household Survey (GHS) data, panel 2018 - 2019, conducted in Nigeria under the collaboration between the World Bank, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the National Food Reserve Agency, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The GHS is a nationally representative survey of approximately 5,000 households from six geopolitical zones in Nigeria. The survey data consists of 3 main questionnaires administered over two rounds (post-planting and post-harvest): household, agricultural, and community. Since the project is not focused on agricultural endeavors, the post-planting survey round served as our main dataset– with a focus on household and community questionnaire responses. The data sections considered from the household and community questionnaires for the project were credit access, food expenditure, food security, dwelling type, economic shock, and food prices. We selected features from the aforementioned data sections for our models to characterize households’ severity of food insecurity and design food baskets. For recommended nutritional components, we used daily recommended values from the U.S. FDA. For the nutritional composition for food items in our dataset, we used the Nutrient Value of Some Common Food document by the Canadian Ministry of Health. For food items that were not found on the aforementioned list, we obtained the nutritional composition value from several other sources. Our data dictionary outlines the data sources used for our project as well as descriptions for all features used.</p>
		  <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
		  <p style="text-align: justify;">Our data cleaning goal was to ensure that our dataset was consistent, complete and ready for further analysis. First, we sought to identify errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in our datasets. This was important to improve the reliability of our results. Our data cleaning for household data was done in R. Our main focus was on re-coding responses into binary values, creating dummy variables for household dwelling types and economic shock features, aggregating household food expenditure for each household, and feature engineering the CSI variable (discussed in section 2.3.). With readily prepared data files, we merged multiple data sets into a single data file on household-level (i.e. a single record for each household) for analysis. Our merged household data file is called hh_data.csv, and comprises 4,170 households with its full variable list outlined in our data dictionary. For the food prices and nutritional components of each food item, we used the food price list from the community questionnaire as the base file. Next, we computed the food nutrient composition for each food item based on standardized units (kilogram for solid food items and liter for liquid food items). This new breakdown is used as our conversion table and is the foodprice_nutrition.csv data file.</p>
